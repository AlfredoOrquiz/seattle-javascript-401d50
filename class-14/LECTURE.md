# Class 14 - Final Realtime Project

## Week in Review

* Observer Pattern:
  * Publishers and Subscribers
    * Publishers: event to publish / payload to send.
    * Subscribers: event to retrieval or listening to / do something in response.
  * Observable Object (eventPool / namespace).
* TCP connection ( transport protocol, send packets to different machines )
  * Socket.io - library (code that we install) controls creating of "sockets"?
  * server and client libraries, why do clients connect to servers?
    * Establish a pathway to talk to something else? other clients / sockets connected to the server.
* Message Queue / Message Client
  * If not connected, The Queue can messages for later.
  * Adding / retrieving / confirming message delivery.

Thanks for reviewing your code Brook!
