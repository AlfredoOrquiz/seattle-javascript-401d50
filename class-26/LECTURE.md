# Class 26 - Atomic Components With React

## Welcome to the Second Half

What's in store for the second half: lots of React
* Hooks - week 6 (The new way of attaching functionality to a component)
* Context - week 7 (shared component state management)
* Redux - week 8 (Global application state)
* React Native- week 9 (Android / iOS Devices)

## Review / Warm Up

* 301 - React Class Components
  * Props - Information  / access to things passed down from parent to child. Parameters that a component NEEDS to do its job.
  * State - Things that a single component needs while it's rendered (temporary).
  * JSX - an extension for javascript(ish) stuff in a React Component.  What is returned / rendered from a component.
