# Warm Up - Linked List Reverse Values

## Overview

Print all the values stored within a linked list in reverse order.

## Challenge

Given a singly linked list of nodes, write a function that will print all node values in reverse order from tail to head.

Input: `head: [2] -> [3] -> [5] -> [10]: tail`\
Output:

```bash
10
5
3
2
```

### Notes

* The original linked list should not be mutated, please ensure that your function does not reverse the original list, only prints the values in reverse order.
