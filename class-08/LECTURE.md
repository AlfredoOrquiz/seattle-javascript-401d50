# Class 08 - Access Control Lists

## Warm Up / Review

## Role Based Access

??? Roles dictate what clients can do within our API:

For a given role, their is a set of capabilities:
* every "resource" has some CRUD:
  * Articles:  READ / CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE
  * Users: READ / CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE
Access Control List:
  map of resources to capabilities base on role.
