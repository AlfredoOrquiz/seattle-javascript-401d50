# Class 09 - Auth Module Projects

## Warm Up / Review

* Whiteboard in a pair or triplet your UML for lab 08.
  * How do our unified API and Auth features fit together?
  * If you have full featured UML, what feature (resource / path) would you add to your API?  How would that change your UML?

* Starting with your UML / show us how your server is wired together.
* Let's see your server code!

Thanks for sharing your Code Robert!
